This repository contains some fun Christmas programs for you to enjoy. Each one is a bit of a puzzle. See if you can figure out what they do from the source code before you run them. Then, follow the directions below to run each one to see if you figured them out correctly:

- innovation.py:
```python innovation.py```

- trust.rs:
```rustc trust.rs; ./trust```

- security.go:
```go run security.go```

Spoiler: You can see the output [here](DETAILS.md).
